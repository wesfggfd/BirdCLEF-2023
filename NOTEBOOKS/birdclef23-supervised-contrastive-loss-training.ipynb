    "# BIRDClef 2023 Training with Supervised Contrastive Learning and PyTorch Lightning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my Kaggle notebook! In this notebook, I'll take you through the process of training a model for the BIRDClef 2023 competition using supervised contrastive learning and PyTorch Lightning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Approach:** I am using supervised contrastive learning, a powerful technique that enhances the performance of models in classification tasks.\n",
    "- **Framework:** The training is implemented using PyTorch Lightning, which simplifies the training process and provides helpful abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different hyperparameters, and adapt the model for your own use cases. If you find this notebook helpful, please consider upvoting it to show your support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Credits:**\n",
    "- This notebook is based on the work of [\n",
    "Nischay Dhankhar](https://www.kaggle.com/nischaydnk/) in their notebook https://www.kaggle.com/nischaydnk/code where I adapted and extended their code for the BIRDClef 2023 competition.\n",
